Using the micro-USB port as the "origin" the board was first calibrated in the proper orientation with z facing upwards, x pointing out of the plane, and y pointing to the right. After calibration, the unit was then rotated 90 degrees about the y axis, with an end position of x pointing downwards and z pointing out of the plane. Unit only stopped at these 2 positions, no other angles were supposed to be held.
